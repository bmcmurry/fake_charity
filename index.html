            Ocean pollution poses a clear and present danger to human health and
            well-being, according to a new study from an international group of
            researchers. The study sounds the alarm that the growing global
            problem, which scientists are only beginning to understand, requires
            urgent and immediate action. It is a call to mobilize, say the
            authors who offer a path forward via pollution prevention and
            research recommendations.

            Covering more than two-thirds of the planet, the oceans provide
            food, livelihoods, and cultural and recreational value to billions
            around the world. Ocean pollution, which stems primarily from human
            activities, threatens these many benefits. More than 80% of ocean
            pollution comes from land-based sources, making its way to the seas
            through runoff, rivers, atmospheric deposition, and direct
            discharges. It is most highly concentrated along the coasts of low-
            and middle-income countries.

            “Ocean pollution is deeply unjust. Its impacts fall most heavily on
            low-income countries, coastal fishing communities, people on small
            island nations, indigenous populations, and people in the high
            Arctic groups that for the most part produce very little pollution
            themselves,” explained Landrigan. “These populations rely on the
            oceans for food. Their survival depends on the health of the seas.”
